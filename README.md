  # How to Run
  To run the program, simply run the Application.java as a Java Application, and the menu will print for you automatically for you to use.
  Make sure that you have all the other required classes in the same package in order to run it.

  # How to Use
  To use the program, look at what the menu has printed, and simply just type a number in the terminal corresponding to what you want to do. 
  From there just keep on following the text that appears in the terminal and following its instructions. These instructions printed vary from the option you choose.
  Some data is already pre-made to play around with if you'd like.

  # Things to note
  To use the billing and payments option, a booking must already have been made to see the booking you want to make a payment for. (I didn't pre-make a booking, so you have to make it)
  The manage functions print the Clients, Pets, and Employees in the system to the terminal if you want to double check the stuff you made.
